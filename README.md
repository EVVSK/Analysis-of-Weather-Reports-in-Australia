# Weather Report Analysis and Prediction in Australia

## Description

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of weather patterns across Australia, combining exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques to uncover key insights and predict future rainfall events. Utilizing a rich dataset of meteorological records, the system identifies regional weather trends, highlights influential climate factors, and deploys predictive models to forecast rainfall with high accuracy of *85%* and MSE score of *0.11* . This work serves as the capstone for the Honors Content module in the Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning course by IBM on Coursera, demonstrating the application of data-driven insights in real-world environmental contexts.

## Features

+ **Data Analysis:** Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, correlations, and anomalies in Australian weather data..
+ **Machine Learning Models:** Implements Linear Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM models for predictive analytics.
+ **Interactive Visualizations:** Delivers clear, insightful visual representations of weather patterns, feature importance, and model predictions for intuitive understanding.
